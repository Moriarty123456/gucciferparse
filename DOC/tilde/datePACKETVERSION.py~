# Value (8 bytes): The value of the DATE is an 8-byte IEEE floating-point number, as specified in [MS-OAUT] section 2.2.25.

#      typedef double DATE;

# The date information is represented by whole-number increments, starting with December 30, 1899 midnight as time zero. The time information is represented by the fraction of a day since the preceding midnight. For example, 6:00 A.M. on January 4, 1900 would be represented by the value 5.25 (5 and 1/4 of a day past December 30, 1899).
